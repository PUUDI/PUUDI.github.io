# Welcome to the Pulin Disanayaka public portofolio!

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Welcome to the repo that I brag about myself and sometime very rarely I share my thoughts with you guys.

Currently I'm working on a Computer Vision project at NUS where I try to generate game map content for games. This is the 2nd research project I'm working on after my undergrad thesis (check out the [abstract](https://science.cmb.ac.lk/icds/icds-2023/proceedings/) if you want).

I have experience working as a ML Engineer at Dialog Axiata, a Telco company. During my time there, I focused on MLOps tasks and managed data pipelines and ML pipelines. One of my notable achievements was developing a segmentation system, which was later implemented company wide based on my blueprint.
