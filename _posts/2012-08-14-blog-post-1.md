# Write your Python code in Rust

## High-Low levels of coding

Python is a language built on top of C language. C is often used to write the underlying implementation of Python itself, as well as many of its libraries and extensions.

Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed by an interpreter. The Python interpreter itself is written in C. It provides the core functionality of the Python language, such as executing Python statements, managing memory, and interacting with the operating system.

Additionally, many popular Python libraries and extensions are implemented in C for performance reasons. C is a low-level language that allows developers to write code that can directly interact with the computer's hardware and operating system. This can result in faster execution times compared to pure Python code.
