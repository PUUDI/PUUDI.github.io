# Write your Python code in Rust

## High-Low levels of coding


In the world of Software Engineering, the choice of programming langugage plays a pivotal role in determining the performance, reliability and scalability. Low-level like Assembly and C have been favoured for critical systems where the performance is paramount.

Microsoft Windows is one of the most popular OS in the Desktop PC's and it's hold 72% of the market share and MS Windows is developed on top of C and certain critical level components like drivers are written in Assembly language for direct machine level operations. Similary other popular Os s' like Linux and MacOS system are built on top of C for their core functionalities.

When it comes to specialized software like self-driving cars that incorporate machine learning algorithms for advanced functionalities, a balance between control and development ease is crucial. For instance, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software utilize the efficiency of C++ for performance-critical tasks with the flexibility of Python for higher-level functionalities.

Microsoft windows mostly written in C and some other support parts in Assembly language which is a machine level code, Linux, Mac systems are also written in C for better performance while operating systems and embedded systems usually written in C when it comes to softwared like self driving for that has some of it's functionalities leveraging machine learning algorithm they use a bit higher level that C, for an example Tesla's FSD (Full Self Driving) software is built using C++ and some other parts in Python and Cuda. This allows developers to access hardware level control while easier higher level to developp while not compromising the performance of low level coding.

In the ML industry

Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed by an interpreter. The Python interpreter itself is written in C. It provides the core functionality of the Python language, such as executing Python statements, managing memory, and interacting with the operating system.

Additionally, many popular Python libraries and extensions are implemented in C for performance reasons. C is a low-level language that allows developers to write code that can directly interact with the computer's hardware and operating system. This can result in faster execution times compared to pure Python code.
