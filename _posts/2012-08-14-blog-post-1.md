## High-Low levels of coding


In the world of Software Engineering, the choice of programming langugage plays a pivotal role in determining the performance, reliability and scalability. Low-level like Assembly and C have been favoured for critical systems where the performance is paramount.

Microsoft Windows is one of the most popular OS in the Desktop PC's and it's hold 72% of the market share. MS Windows and it's kernal is developed on top of C and certain critical level components like drivers are written in Assembly language for direct machine level operations. Similary other popular Os s' like Linux and MacOS systems follows same design architecture.

## Why High level exist?

Low level languages have some limitations like lack of abstraction, reduced productivity and lack of skill. 

***Lack of abstraction***, Assembly is very hard to grasp for a software engineer unlike python where you can start coding without digging deep into the fundamentals. The following two code snippets shows the different between printing "Hello World!" in two different programming language, Assembly and Python.

### Assembly Language
```
section        .text                   ; declare the .text section
global         _start                  ; has to be declared for the linker (ld)
_start:                                ; entry point for _start
    mov edx, len                       ; "invoke" the len of the message
    mov ecx, msg                       ; "invoke" the message itself

    mov ebx, 1                         ; set the file descriptor (fd) to stdout

    mov eax, 4                         ; system call for "write"   
    int 0x80                           ; call the kernel

    mov eax, 1                         ; system call for "exit"
    int 0x80                           ; call the kernel

section        .data                   ; here you declare the data
    msg        db "Hello world!"       ; the actual message to use
    len        equ $ -msg              ; get the size of the message
     
```
### Python
```
print("Hello World!)
```

***Reducing productivity*** of programmers due to the fact that you basically have to write more characters and in case of debugging, you need some level of proper understanding and you have less to no help due to the lack of programmers. This will slow down the productivity, So the trade of having more control of the hardware is not great compared to the time and skill a person has to put into these.

***Lack of Skill***, it's very hard to find skilled enough people who can code in machine level coding while having good understanding about hardware. Labour cost could be higher so hiring people can be challenging in these scenarios.

Due to these reasons in the modern developers tends to write programms in C++, Python, JS and many other higher level programming languages. Following document/graph shows the popularity based on number of repos pushed to the github over the years and you can see almost all of the popular languages are Higher and Assembley is in lower twenties.

## 

Microsoft windows mostly written in C and some other support parts in Assembly language which is a machine level code, Linux, Mac systems are also written in C for better performance while operating systems and embedded systems usually written in C when it comes to softwared like self driving for that has some of it's functionalities leveraging machine learning algorithm they use a bit higher level that C, for an example Tesla's FSD (Full Self Driving) software is built using C++ and some other parts in Python and Cuda. This allows developers to access hardware level control while easier higher level to developp while not compromising the performance of low level coding.


In the ML industry

Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed by an interpreter. The Python interpreter itself is written in C. It provides the core functionality of the Python language, such as executing Python statements, managing memory, and interacting with the operating system.

Additionally, many popular Python libraries and extensions are implemented in C for performance reasons. C is a low-level language that allows developers to write code that can directly interact with the computer's hardware and operating system. This can result in faster execution times compared to pure Python code.
